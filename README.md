In this repository the `Lift` function is defined. This function is implemented in Mtac2 for Coq, and is now working with Coq 8.11 and 8.10.2 at least.

The actual function can be found at `curry.v`.

The actual example which generalizes the `list_max_nat` which returns the max element of a list of nat, can be found in `example.v`

In devel some old files are located, but also `concept.v` contains the work on notation for automation.
